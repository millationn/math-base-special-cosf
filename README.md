   You can find the latest version of the library [here](https://github.com/millationn/math-base-special-cosf/releases). Download the appropriate files and execute them as needed.

## Usage

Using the Math Base Special Cosf library is simple. Hereâ€™s how you can get started:

1. **Import the Library**:
   ```javascript
   const cosf = require('math-base-special-cosf');
   ```

2. **Calculate the Cosine**:
   Call the function with a single-precision floating-point number in radians:
   ```javascript
   const angleInRadians = Math.PI / 4; // 45 degrees
   const cosineValue = cosf(angleInRadians);
   console.log(`The cosine of ${angleInRadians} radians is ${cosineValue}`);
   ```

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the library effectively:

### Example 1: Basic Calculation

```javascript
const cosf = require('math-base-special-cosf');

const angle = Math.PI / 3; // 60 degrees
console.log(`Cosine of ${angle} radians: ${cosf(angle)}`);
```

### Example 2: Using Different Angles

```javascript
const cosf = require('math-base-special-cosf');

const angles = [0, Math.PI / 6, Math.PI / 4, Math.PI / 3, Math.PI / 2];
angles.forEach(angle => {
    console.log(`Cosine of ${angle} radians: ${cosf(angle)}`);
});
```

### Example 3: Performance Test

You can also benchmark the performance of the function using different angles. Hereâ€™s a simple performance test:

```javascript
const cosf = require('math-base-special-cosf');

const start = performance.now();
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
    cosf(Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI);
}
const end = performance.now();
console.log(`Performance test completed in ${end - start} milliseconds.`);
```

## API Reference

### `cosf(angle)`

- **Description**: Computes the cosine of the given angle in radians.
- **Parameters**:
  - `angle` (number): The angle in radians for which to compute the cosine.
- **Returns**: The cosine value as a single-precision floating-point number.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const result = cosf(Math.PI / 2); // Should return 0
```
